# Advanced Solidity Interview Questions

1. **What are the differences between `delegatecall` and `call` in Solidity?**
   - Discuss their implications on context and state changes, and provide examples of when to use each.

2. **How would you implement upgradable smart contracts?**
   - Discuss different patterns (like the proxy pattern) and their trade-offs in terms of complexity and security.

3. **What is a “reentrancy attack,” and how can it be prevented?**
   - Provide examples of vulnerable patterns and describe best practices to mitigate such attacks.

4. **Explain the concept of "EIP-721" and how to implement an ERC-721 token.**
   - What are the key functions and events required for a non-fungible token, and how does it differ from ERC-20?

5. **What is the "Circuit Breaker" pattern, and how can it be implemented in a contract?**
   - Explain how this pattern can be used to pause operations in emergencies and provide an example.
